## Technical Details

### Assessment Methodology

**Scoring Framework**:
```python
ASSESSMENT_CRITERIA = {
    'environment_mastery': {
        'weight': 20,
        'components': ['creation', 'validation', 'performance'],
        'passing_score': 80
    },
    'dataset_expertise': {
        'weight': 20, 
        'components': ['loading', 'analysis', 'search', 'quality'],
        'passing_score': 80
    },
    'interactive_control': {
        'weight': 20,
        'components': ['responsiveness', 'coordination', 'stability'],
        'passing_score': 80
    },
    'analysis_visualization': {
        'weight': 20,
        'components': ['data_collection', 'live_plotting', 'metrics'],
        'passing_score': 80
    },
    'system_integration': {
        'weight': 20,
        'components': ['workflow', 'problem_solving', 'integration'],
        'passing_score': 80
    }
}
```

### Graduation Requirements

**Mastery Standards**:
```python
GRADUATION_REQUIREMENTS = {
    'minimum_overall_score': 400,  # 80% of 500 total points
    'no_failing_challenges': True, # All challenges must pass
    'demonstration_quality': 'proficient', # Above basic level
    'independence_level': 'high', # Minimal guidance needed
    'readiness_assessment': 'advanced_topics' # Ready for Unit 2
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Assessment Issues

**Problem**: Challenge execution fails
**Solution**: Check system requirements and setup
```python
# Verify system readiness for assessment
def verify_assessment_readiness():
    checks = []
    
    # Check LocoMuJoCo installation
    try:
        import loco_mujoco
        checks.append("LocoMuJoCo: OK")
    except ImportError:
        checks.append("LocoMuJoCo: MISSING - reinstall required")
    
    # Check dataset availability
    cache_dir = os.path.expanduser("~/.loco-mujoco-caches")
    if os.path.exists(cache_dir):
        checks.append("Datasets: OK")
    else:
        checks.append("Datasets: MISSING - run cache setup")
    
    return checks
```

**Problem**: Low assessment scores despite lesson completion
**Solution**: Review and practice specific skills
```python
# Targeted skill improvement recommendations
def get_improvement_recommendations(challenge_scores):
    recommendations = []
    
    for challenge, score in challenge_scores.items():
        if score < 80:
            if challenge == "environment_mastery":
                recommendations.append("Practice: Lesson 1.1 and 1.8")
            elif challenge == "dataset_expertise":
                recommendations.append("Practice: Lessons 1.2, 1.3, and 1.7")
            # ... more targeted recommendations
    
    return recommendations
```
